Collected and processed 15,000+ used car listings performing data cleaning, imputation, and feature engineering (categorical 
encoding, feature scaling, outlier handling).

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing price.

Achieved top performance with KNN Regressor and Random Forest Regressor, followed by hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.

Evaluated models with RÂ² score, MAE, and RMSE, delivering high prediction accuracy for unseen data
